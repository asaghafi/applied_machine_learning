# Applied Machine Learning

I am sharing my material for Applied Machine Learning (DS 403) course. I strongly believe in "Knowledge increases by sharing", hope students and instructors in this field find these material useful and follow this motto so we all benefit.

It took me some time to collect and organize the material after teaching the course a number of times. If you are an instructor, feel free to use the material in your course, please don't remove my name and credentials from the slides, you may add yours. For students, dive in and share if you find the stuff useful.

Have fun!
